# Maxime's LISt Processing Language (MLISP)

A hobby pet project of mine to learn programming language design with a simple lisp.

# TODO
- Add first order functions, and conditional statements into language grammar.
- Move away from MPC for AST creation and implement my own language parser.
- Write memory pooling algorithms and avoid so many calls to malloc.
- Create operating system interaction for file reading and writing.
- Implement Tail Call optimization when working with recursive functions.
